            <h5 class="about-us-heading mt-5">TRANSFER OF THE SPONSORED STRUCTURE TO THIRD PARTIES</h5>
            <p>No account shall be ceded or assigned to any third party, due to the risk of cybercrimes. Despite any other terms and conditions contained herein, Apex Capital Assets reserves the right, in exceptional circumstances, to change the account holder detail.</p>
            <h5 class="about-us-heading mt-5">CLOSING PROVISIONS, ESCAPE CLAUSE</h5>
            <p>Apex Capital Assets shall be entitled to modify this General Terms and Conditions for sponsor members from time to time. The modifications are published by Apex Capital Assets in the official Apex Capital Assets website \<a href="www.acassets.com">www.acassets.com</a> <br>
                The modifications and amendments of this Agreement are valid exclusively in writing. <br>
                In case any provision of this Agreement for sponsors becomes invalid or is incomplete, it does not result in the invalidity of the whole Agreement, but the invalid or incomplete provision shall be substituted with a provision that is closest to the invalid or incomplete provision from an economic point of view. The same applies to the termination of shortcomings demanding valid regulation.</p>
